Images2CoT is a program designed to read the exif headers of a list of jpeg
images and compile the information into a Cursor on Target XML feed used to
display data into SwathViewer (http://sv.gina.alaska.edu/).

INSTALLING
==========

GIT repository checkout (requires git. See http://http://git-scm.com/ ):

Run this as a non-priviledged user:

    $ git clone git@git.gina.alaska.edu:images2cot/mainline.git images2cot

A folder called `images2cot' will be copied into your current working
directory.

Since Images2CoT is a Python program that uses the PyGTK+ wrapper for it's
GUI, you will need to ensure you have:

    Python 2.4+  ( See http://python.org/ )
    PyGTK 2.0+   ( See http://www.pygtk.org/ )

Images2CoT also requires that you download, compile, and install and
accessible in your $PATH:

    jhead 2.87+  ( See http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/ )

cd into the images2cot directory:

    $ cd images2cot/
    $ ls
    i2c/ images2cot/ README setup.py

As root, run setup.py:

    # python setup.py install

Now, cd into i2c/
    
    $ cd i2c/

You are ready to run the application:

    $ ./i2c.py
